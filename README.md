# Grace Music
Grace Music's application for ear training and sight reading.

==============================================================
# v. 1.0.0

Currently, this backend API will be what powers and drives the client side app that users will interact with. No link is officially set, because we are awaiting the final UI mockups from the designer on the project. 

This website will provide everyday churchmen and churchwomen the opportunity to hone their musical skills through a sight reading and ear training curriculum designed by Dr. Dan Kreider, Minister of Music at Grace Immanuel Bible Church in Jupiter, FL. 

Users can create an account and also login to their existing accounts before coming to a portal with available courses and the lessons that belong to those courses. As they move through the course, they can mark off completed lessons and keep track of their progress. If they come across any bugs or issues, they can leave an inquiry on the contact form and the admin team can get in touch with them quickly.

The tests are located in a test/ folder in both the frontend application and backend application. The front-end tests will change once the official designs arrive, but the tests in the back-end portion will likely remain close to the original. They can be ran with a simple "npm -i jest" command in the terminal.

The api access is restricted by authorization and by JWT tokens, and the endpoints will be added once the final designs for the application arrive. Each portion of the database has standard RESTful endpoints that can be accessed by admin and authorized users. 

The tech stack for the project is currently PostgreSQL // Node.js / Express.js // React.js, but will be modified to PostgreSQL // Node.js / Express.js // React Native upon delivery of the design. 

Thank you so much for reading, and I hope you enjoy the application if you choose to use it! If you have any questions or come across any issues, feel free to send me an email at mattrobinson412@gmail.com.
